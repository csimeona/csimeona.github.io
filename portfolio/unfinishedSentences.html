							<p><strong>Project Context: </strong>During our class last spring with Professor Elwood, two other classmates and us teamed up to work on a research project in partnership with <a href="http://unfinishedsentences.org">Unfinished Sentences</a>, an initiative organization of the UW Center for Human Rights whom focus their efforts in research towards past human rights crimes committed during the Salvadoran Civil War. </p>
							
							<p><em>The war</em>, which lasted from 1980 to 1992, was fought between the Salvadoran Military and various leftist groups, and was a conflict driven by an intergenerational history of economic, political and social exclusion. By the end of the war at least 75,000 civilians, women and children included, lost their lives; oftentimes victims of ‘scorched earth’ military tactics, which “wiped entire villages from the map”. Many more civilians were disappeared, tortured and/or displaced.<br><br> Efforts for justice and accountability for these past crimes have been largely ignored by institutions of justice. This in turn has played a role in nation's crisis of poverty and violence today, as there is a “widespread perception that institutions of justice are inoperable”. 
							</p>
							
							<p><em>Our partners mission</em> is in providing productivity within these judicial institutions, by challenging laws and declassifying documents for example. Another main objective of the organization is in preserving the memories of the war’s victims and survivors through recorded interviews, and in educating a broad public audience about the war’s violence, and of today’s efforts towards justice. 
							</p>

						
							<p><strong>Project goals</strong> of our collaboration was to produce a map prototype which could assist the organization in its objectives towards education. It was desired that this map would express the broad scale of civilian targeted massacres, and act as an interactive information resource which linked users to additional external information obtained through the organization’s efforts.
							</p>
						
							<p>Some implied goals were to put the places, its people and their voices which were “wiped from the map” back onto the map, and to communicate the fact that although these crimes have gone largely without justice in the past, they have not been forgotten, and the fight for justice persists today through the efforts of an international network of survivors, individuals and organizations.
							</p>
						
							<p><strong>Methods: </strong>The data to be mapped was compiled by an organization named Grupo Maiz, and provided to us by our partners in the form of photographs of a wall poster. The poster containes a list of 198 reported massacres and represents 7,509 victims. The following is one of the photographs:

							</p>
							
							<p>Our first step was to digitize the information into an Excel table. This was done manually, with geographic coordinate attributes found using geonames.org to geocode places by name. The following photo shows a portion of our dataset in its final format:
							<br><br>
							<img src="https://csimeona.github.io/images/unfinishedSentencesDB.JPG" border="0" alt="unfinishedSentencesDB.jpg" style="width:80%; margin-left:10%;"/>	
							</p>
							
							<p>The next step was to decide the best mapping solution for our partners. After exploring and implementing mock-ups using online web mapping services provided by MapBox.com and CartoDB.com, we met with our partners and decided to ultimately produce our map using the MapBox JavaScript library, which would allow us to implement additional features and interactive capabilities for the map. We then designed the map with consideration of where it would likely be <a href='http://unfinishedsentences.org/about/'>placed</a>.</p>

								<strong>Project Goal: </strong> To create a web map of human rights violations occuring in the 1980-1992 El Salvadoran civil War -- for historical memory preservation and educational purposes. <strong>Secondary goals of the web map:</strong> 
								<ul>
									<li>Temporal and text filtering abilities</li>
									<li>Bilingual abilities</li>
									<li>Department aggregations</li>
									<li>High visibility of instances with available research by our partners</li>
								</ul>
								
							</p>
								
							<p>
								<strong>Completed for: </strong>My GIS capstone project, in partnership with the UW Center for Human Rights' Unfinished Sentences project, which provides research focused on the preservation and education of historical memory of the Salvadoran conflict's human rights violations, as well as justice and accountability for their victims and perpetrators.

						<p><strong>Results: </strong> Ultimately, we feel our collaboration produced a map which accomplished our goals  (Show Map). We can see the broad scale of violence, the progression of justice with resources linked; and the  places/people/voices which were wiped from the map during the war -- their numbers represented by size). <br><br>Additionally, javascript allowed us to give users of the map the ability to switch between various basemaps; to search/filter by text; to filter by time; and to dynamically calculate aggregate statistics. We feel these additions can make the map a useful organizational tool for the CHR, and that they will enhance spatial thinking among users in order to provoke further discussion.
